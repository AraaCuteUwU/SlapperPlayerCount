# CrossOnlineCount
Get the players of another server with Slapper!
## Information
This is made from jasonwynn10, but updated for the latest API and uses Async Tasks to not lag the server.
## Usage
On your slapper, just put the IP and port of the server like `IP:Port`. Here is an example:

/slapper create human KitPvP Server{line}127.0.0.1:19132

When you create the slapper, it will now replace the IP and port with the amount online, such as `1 online`. If the plugin cannot query the server, it will replace the IP and port with `Server Offline`.
