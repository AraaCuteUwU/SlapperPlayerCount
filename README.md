## Information
This is made from jasonwynn10, but updated for the latest API and uses Async Tasks to not lag the server.
## Usage
On your slapper, just put the IP and port of the server like `IP:Port`.

Easy to use, and super simple. Because this uses a special type of task (AsyncTask), this won't lag your server, and you're good to go!
